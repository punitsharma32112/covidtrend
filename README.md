- Daily confirmed cases
- Death counts
- Recoveries
- Country-wise and date-wise distributions

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned for smooth analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Track daily and cumulative trends of COVID-19 cases.
- Compare the spread across different countries/regions.
- Identify peaks, plateaus, and drops using rolling averages.
- Visualize death-to-case ratios and recovery rates.

## 📈 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Insights (Examples)

- Countries with early lockdown showed flatter curves.
- Significant rise in cases during specific months (e.g., mid-2020).
- Recovery rate improved drastically post vaccine rollouts.
